/*
Given an integer array of n integers, find sum of bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements.
Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y.
For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2. Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111( first and last bits differ in two numbers).
